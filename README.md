Whatsapp Chat Analysis for the QLO group
What does engagement on the 'QLO Coordination' whatsapp group look like?



Since Nov 2023, since we gave up our old working locations at Bangalore, 891 messages have been shared on the group. These do not include deleted messages and additions of users by the QLO coordination team.
Total number of images shared: 186
Total number of videos shared: 24
Total polls conducted: 40
Total number of contact cards shared: 2

21% of these messages are images :) We love sharing pictures.




Since January, the number of messages has increased till March, which speaks for Bangalore Quest-ians returning to office.​​



The 5 insights from these messages are :

QLO loves food! The top messages were from Sanjeeth. Other popular people follow suit to keep the group and QLO running.



The most used words in the messages show how the QLO coordination group plans travel and food options and shares updates on the office space. The emojis we use in our messages testify to how loving and fun-loving we are!


The chattiest days are Fridays (the first Friday planning contributes), and Wednesday-Friday is the busiest period.


The second half of the day is busy, along with the 9-10 am in the morning when most people come to the office.

However, when we look at insights 4 and 5 together, we see Friday's second half is the busiest time ( Fun Fridays at QLO) and Wed, Tuesday and Thursday at 9-10 am, coming to the office takes priority.



Feel free to hypothesise why some other time slots are lighter (lighter means a higher number of messages).

We welcome non-Bangalore Quest-ians to come to this amazing space and join us on a Fun Friday (or any other day).

It could also be interesting to test out some WhatsApp groups currently anchored similarly by program teams. Any thoughts/ideas on this are welcome :)
